    I have a Bachelors Degree in Business Studies and Information Technology from from Maseno University.</p>
    I am Self-motivated; customer focused and would wish each and every client to feel recognized and satisfied. I do also havestrong inter-personal skills, keen to details and results driven. I am a graduate in Business studies and information technology.With the growing number of people accessing the Internet via smartphones and tablets, mobile app development has the unique ability to access a large number of potential consumers.</p>

All that is left for you to do, is to develop an effective app and reap the benefits of your labors.
Making it easier for customers to interact, buy from you, book with you and generally do business with you. There is almost always a similar website that does the same job as these types of apps but the difference is that these apps connect you to 'what you want' faster and without going through the internet.</p>

    <p>Formula one
        At its core, <a href="https://www.formula1.com/" target="_blank">Formula One!</a>, like most motorsports, is pretty simple to understand: car drive fast, first car across the line wins! Drivers and their teams are awarded points based on where they finish, and the driver and team with the most points at the end of the season are crowned world champions!!
